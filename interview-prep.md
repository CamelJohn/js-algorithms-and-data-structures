## **1. Coding & Algorithm Practice**

Even for senior fullstack/backend roles, you’ll face algorithm/data structure questions.

**Focus areas**:

- Arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks/queues, heaps, hash maps
- Trees, binary search trees, graphs, tries
- Sorting & searching (binary search, mergesort, quicksort)
- Dynamic programming (classic: LIS, knapsack, DP on trees)
- Concurrency & async patterns (JS async/await, Promises, Node event loop)
- Bit manipulation (rare, but sometimes comes up)

**Suggested plan**:

- Solve **1–2 problems per day** on LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal (mix easy/medium/hard).
- Time yourself to simulate interview pressure.

**Tip:** After solving, explain your solution **out loud**, as if talking to an interviewer. This builds articulation under pressure.

## **2. JavaScript/TypeScript Internals**

Interviewers love probing **deep understanding**, especially if you’re a Node/React engineer.
Key topics:

- Event loop, microtasks vs macrotasks, concurrency model
- `this` binding, closures, scopes, **lexical scoping**
- Prototype chain & inheritance
- `call`, `apply`, `bind`
- **Currying** & higher-order functions
- Hoisting & temporal dead zone
- Garbage collection & memory leaks
- Modules (ESM vs CommonJS)
- TS types, generics, mapped types, type inference, type guards
- Node internals: streams, buffers, cluster module, process.nextTick, libuv

**Practice approach**:

- Pick a topic and explain it **as if teaching someone**.
- Write small snippets to prove your understanding.

## **3. System Design & Architecture**

Expect high-level questions for **scaling, reliability, and design patterns**.
**Key topics for your stack**:

- Designing APIs: REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC
- Caching & database strategies: Redis, DynamoDB, Postgres, MongoDB
- Queues & async flows: SQS, SNS, Kafka, RabbitMQ, BullMQ
- Event-driven architecture & serverless design
- CI/CD & infrastructure: GitHub Actions, Terraform, CloudFormation
- Scalability: horizontal vs vertical scaling, stateless services, caching patterns
- Observability: logging, metrics, tracing

**Practice approach**:

- Pick a common service and design it (e.g., **URL shortener**, **chat system**, **e-commerce cart**)
- Cover **API, data model, scaling, failure handling**
- Use whiteboard or draw diagrams

---

## **4. Behavioral & Situational**

Even for senior roles, behavioral questions appear.

- STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- Challenges, failures, team conflict, leadership, trade-offs
- Open-ended questions: “How do you choose between SQL and NoSQL?” or “How do you design a rate limiter?”

---

## **5. Tradeoffs, Architecture & Real-World Design**

Senior engineers are expected to justify design decisions and understand **tradeoffs** between different architectures and technologies.

**Core areas to master:**

- **Monolith vs Microservices** — simplicity vs scalability, deployment complexity, organizational impact.
- **Dockerization & Containerization** — consistency, isolation, orchestration (Docker Compose, ECS, Kubernetes).
- **Serverless vs Containers vs VMs** — cost, scalability, cold starts, latency.
- **Database per service vs Shared DB** — data ownership, transaction boundaries, complexity.
- **Consistency vs Availability (CAP theorem)** — eventual vs strong consistency, use cases for each.
- **Stateful vs Stateless services** — scaling, fault tolerance, sticky sessions.
- **Caching layers** — in-memory (Redis) vs distributed (CDN, CloudFront).
- **API Gateway vs Direct service calls** — centralization vs flexibility, observability tradeoffs.
- **Deployment strategies** — blue-green, canary, rolling updates.
- **Observability & resilience** — circuit breakers, retries, idempotency, tracing.

**Practice approach:**

- Pick a feature (e.g., notifications, authentication, file uploads) and design it under **different architectural styles**.
- Discuss why you'd choose one approach over another given team size, scaling needs, and cost.

### **How we can practice here**

We can do **simulated interviews** in two modes:

1. **Coding round simulation**

   - I give you a problem, you code, I give feedback, we iterate

2. **System design / architecture simulation**

   - I ask a design question; you outline your solution, I probe, and we refine

3. **JS/TS internals rapid-fire**

   - I ask tricky questions (“What happens if you do X?”), you answer, I give corrections

We can even **mix all three** into a full mock interview, time-boxed to ~45–60 minutes.

---

If you want, I can **start by giving you a first mock interview** that mixes **JS internals, coding problem, and system design**, to see where you stand and what needs focus.

Do you want me to do that?
